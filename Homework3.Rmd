##Introduction 

- To begin our discussion of this paper, we should recall an important equation:

- $$V_P = V_G + V_E$$

- Total phenotypic variation is the sum of the contributions of genetic variation and environmental variation 

- $$\mbox{Today we're going to focus on }V_E$$ 

##Another Equation

- $$V_E = V_{Eg} + V_{GxE} + V_{ES}$$
- $$V_{Eg}:$$
- General environmental varience 

- $$V_{ES}:$$
- Specific environmental varience 

- $$V_{GxE}:$$
- Genotype by environment interaction (what this paper was interested in)

##Characterizing GxE

- Regulatory Divergence 

- Allele-specific Expression (ASE)

##Main goals of this paper
 >- \color{purple} "determine the prevalence of GxE interactions affecting the expression of native and non-native alleles"
 
 >- \color{green} "characterize the relative contributions of cis and/or trans regulatory variation in expression divergence"
 
 >- \color{blue} "establish the role of genome structure (e.g.inversions) in the evolution of potentially locally adaptive regulatory variation"
 
 >- \color{orange} "identify candidate genes underlying local adaptation in this system"

 {\tiny This is the first figure from this paper. A shows a map of the locations of their two transplant sites. B shows a picture of the blue location and C shows a picture of the red location. D compares the expression of coastal alleles at both sites, while E shows the same for inland allele. F shows the difference in survival between parental plants and F1 hybrids at each site.}
